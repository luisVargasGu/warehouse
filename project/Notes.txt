Step 1:

Created the needed classes following our design implementation. Subject to change. 

Step 2:

Created the constructor and getAmount()-which returns the number of fascia in that lane in the Warehouse. The constructor will read from the traversal table, so that we can record the amount of fascia in each lane found in the Warehouse.  

Step 3:

Completed WarehouseTesting.java, which has the testing for Warehouse.java. Also completed the constructor for Order.java, which takes in stings colour and model as parameters. Currently SKU front and back are set up to be private, so I have also set up getters and setters. However that is subject to change these variable may become public, based on how SKUReader is implemented. OrderTesting has also been set up, however it doesnâ€™t test the getters/setters yet. Also created a folder called Testing files where we can store our test files for file testing. 

Step 4:

Completed Documentation for WarehouseTesting.java. Completed QueueOfOrders.java were we have the queue as a array list, this may be subjected to change. Also finished  QueueOfOrdersTesting.java, which contains the testing for QueueOfOrders.java. I have also started The constructor and the addOrders() method which is packages 4 orders into one picking Request.
